# hellfire
 more info ok? | 
as said before, we are proship/fic, anti-censorship, and anti-harassment. we do not talk about it with people who are uncomfortable with it. we do think fiction can affect reality. | 
now that that's out of the way, hi! we are the hellfire collective. we are a system, obviously. headmates tend to play this game, but you'll usually see eddie online. | 
some of our  interests are: it 2017/2019 + book + welcome to derry, stranger things, musicals, fob, p!atd, mcr, chappell roan, smosh, the black phone, metal lords, starkid, co09, sally face, tdlosk, creepypasta, mlp, twd, and yellowjackets, among other things. |
